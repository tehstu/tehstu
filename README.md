- 👋 Hi, I’m Stu.
- 👀 I’m interested in hobbyist scripting, mostly Python. I occasionally dabble in R, and many moons ago was fluent in C/Fortran77. I aspire to write something useful for my Rasperrby Pi, Micro:bit or PICO-8.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning as much Python as I can find the time to.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on Advent of Code! I like to keep my brain ticking over.
- 📫 You can reach me at https://mstdn.social/@tehstu
